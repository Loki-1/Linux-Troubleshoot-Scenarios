├── Ping the server by Hostname and IP Address
│ ├── Hostname/IP Address is pingable
│ │ ├── Issue might be on the client side as server is reachable
│ ├── Hostname is not pingable but IP Address is pingable
│ │ ├── Could be the DNS issue
│ │ │ ├── check /etc/hosts

│ │ │ ├── check /etc/nsswitch.conf
│ │ │ ├── (Optional) DNS can also be defined in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>
│ ├── Hostname/IP Address both are not pingable
│ │ ├── Check the other server on its same network to see if there is Network side access issue or other overall something bad
│ │ │ ├── False: Issue is not overall network side but its with that host/server
│ │ │ ├── True: Might be overall network side issue
│ │ ├── Logged into server by Virtual Console, if the server is PoweredON. Checkthe uptime
│ │ ├── Check if the server has the IP, and has UP status of Network interface
│ │ │ ├── (Optional) Also check IP related information from /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>
